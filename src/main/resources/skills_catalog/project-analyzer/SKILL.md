# Project Analyzer Skill

Use this skill when a user asks for implementation work in the current repository.

## Workflow

1. Discover structure first.
2. Read relevant files before editing.
3. Implement minimal, targeted changes.
4. Verify with lightweight checks when possible.

## Suggested commands

- `rg --files`
- `rg -n "<keyword>" <path>`
- `mvn -q -DskipTests compile`

## Notes

- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Keep behavior backward compatible unless user asks otherwise.
